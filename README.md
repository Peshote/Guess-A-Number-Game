The "Guess a Number" Game is a simple console-based C# game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Players progress through multiple levels of increasing difficulty, aiming to complete all levels as quickly as possible.

## Project Overview

This project implements a game in which players guess a randomly generated number based on the level they are playing. The game features the following mechanics:

- Each level presents a new range for guessing a number.
- Players are provided feedback on their guesses (Too High, Too Low, or Correct).
- The game tracks completion time and displays the best time record.
- Players have the option to play again after completing all levels.

## How to Play

1. Run the program to start the game.
2. In each level, guess a number within the specified range.
3. Receive feedback on your guess and continue until you guess correctly.
4. Complete all levels to finish the game.
5. Your completion time and best time record will be displayed.
6. Choose to play again or exit the game.

## Solution

- Developed using Visual Studio with .NET Core (version 3.1).

## Core Concepts Utilized

This project demonstrates the application of various programming concepts, including:

- Variables: Used to track game statistics, player input, and random number generation.
- Loops: Implemented to iterate through levels and prompt players to play again.
- Conditional Statements: Used to determine game outcomes and provide feedback to players.
- Methods: The Main method serves as the entry point and controls game flow.
- Enumeration Values: ConsoleColor enumeration is used to enhance the console output.

## How to Run
